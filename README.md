# flying pizzas 2D game

This "jump over obstacles" game comes from my [C++ course](https://www.udemy.com/course/cpp-fundamentals/), as part of an innovation/education week at my first workplace in software: [Beijer Electronics](https://www.beijerelectronics.com).

Apart from coding along and learning syntax, I actively refactored/improved my code throughout the course. I also put a focus on showing my workflow through commit messages.

And to add a bit of myself to the game, instead of flying nebulas as obstacles, I decided to use flying Hawaii pizzas. I also modified the background image too - can you spot my customisations? :)

## how to run

To run this project, raylib is required, and can be downloaded from: https://www.raylib.com/

To play the game on your machine, use <kbd>spacebar</kbd> to jump over the pizzas coming at you!
